Use the posted solutions to questions 1 and 2 of the previous (ER) homework and convert each one
of the diagram into a skeleton relational database schema using the procedure and notation that we
used in class.
Please pay attention to the following:
 Type your solution using double spacing.
 You must submit the solutions to both problems.
 I reserve the right to grade either or both of them.
 Express every relation in the form: R (A, B, C, D, E); Underline a primary key for each relation.
 Write the attributes of a composite key adjacent to each other – just like A, B in R (A, B, C, D E).
 Submit a printed copy at the beginning of class on the due date.
